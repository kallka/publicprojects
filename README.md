# Description: An application of Graph traversal to solve a problem.
#              The function takes a 2-D puzzle of size m by n (n rows and m columns) where  n >= 3;
#              m >= 3; and m and n can be of different sizes. Each cell in the puzzle is either marked by
#              '-' to show an empty, traversable space or by '#' to show a barrier. Two coordinates are given:
#              (a,b) for the current location and (x,y) for desired destination. The puzzle piece may only
#              move up, down, left or right. Return the path to (x,y) by covering the minimum number of cells.
