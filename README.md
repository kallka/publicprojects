Description: An application of Graph traversal to solve a problem.
The function takes a 2-D puzzle of size m by n (n rows and m columns) where  n >= 3; m >= 3; and m and n can be of different sizes. Each cell in the puzzle is either marked by '-' to show an empty, traversable space or by '#' to show a barrier. Two coordinates are given: (a,b) for the current location and (x,y) for desired destination. The puzzle piece may only move up, down, left or right. Return the path to (x,y) by covering the minimum number of cells.
